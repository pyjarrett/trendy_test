-- A super simple testing library for Ada.  This aims for minimum registration
-- and maximum ease of use.  "Testing in as few lines as possible."  There is
-- no code generation or external tooling required for this testing library to
-- work.
--
-- There are no `Set_Up` or `Tear_Down` routines, if you want that behavior,
-- you can write it yourself, after the registration function in the test.
--
-- There's magic going on behind the scenes here, but don't worry about it.  You
-- really don't want to know the sausage is made.
